During the Year, the revenue of the Group increased by approximately 47.8% year-on-year to approximately HK$528.6 million as compared to approximately HK$357.7 million last year. The revenue comprised sales and distribution of vehicles and related components, provision of engineering services and licencing income of approximately HK$104.8 million (2020: HK$3.5 million), sales of jewellery products, watches and other commodities of approximately HK$377.2 million (2020: HK$291.9 million), interest income from loan financing of approximately HK$45.1 million (2020: HK$46.0 million) and rental income from investment properties of approximately HK$1.4 million (2020: HK$16.3 million). During the Year, sales and distribution of vehicles and related components, provision of engineering services and licencing income increased due to (i) the delivery of Apollo IEs during the Year; (ii) the revenue contributed by Ideenion Group following the completion of the acquisition of Ideenion during the Year; and (iii) the licencing income from the license of vehicular platform. Sales of jewellery products, watches and other commodities increased due to improved sentiment in the retail market. Income from loan financing remained stable. In addition, rental income decreased as certain investment properties in Shenyang, PRC were expropriated by the local government. The Group’s gross profit amounted to approximately HK$131.5 million for the Year as compared to approximately HK$125.9 million last year. The gross profit margin decreased to approximately 24.9% (2020: 35.2%) mainly due to (i) the change of sales mix during the Year; and (ii) the decrease in margin from the sales of jewellery products, watches and other commodities to boost sales. Other gains and losses, net for the Year mainly comprised: (i) gain on disposal of subsidiaries of approximately HK$35.8 million (2020: loss on disposal of a subsidiary of approximately HK$10.2 million); (ii) impairment of loans receivable of approximately HK$12.5 million (2020: HK$29.1 million); (iii) impairment of prepayments, deposits and other receivables of approximately HK$23.9 million (2020: Nil); (iv) fair value gains on financial assets at fair value through profit or loss of approximately HK$21.9 million (2020: fair value losses on financial assets at fair value through profit or loss of approximately HK$133.3 million); and (v) fair value losses on contingent consideration payables of approximately HK$56.0 million (2020: HK$21.9 million) arising from the Group’s acquisitions, the increase of which is mainly due to the change in share prices of the Company as at the year-end dates, which then affects the fair value of the contingent consideration shares. General and administrative expenses increased by 72.7% to approximately HK$294.8 million (2020: HK$170.6 million) mainly due to the equity-settled share option expense of approximately HK$106.9 million (2020: HK$3.0 million) recorded during the Year. Income tax expense significantly decreased due to the inclusion of a one-off tax provision resulting from the expropriation of investment properties recorded last year. As a result of the foregoing, the Group’s loss for the Year was approximately HK$359.4 million (2020: HK$359.4 million).
