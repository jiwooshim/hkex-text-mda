In response to the uncertainties of the persistent epidemic effect, the Group will consider to tighten its control over the operating costs in the short term proactively and effectively.

In addition to its own research and development team, the Group also cooperated with some international well-known chemical corporations (including Germany and Japan) to develop new products and entered into technology cooperation agreements with several sophisticated technology experts in the industry (including those from countries and regions such as Japan, Taiwan and Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (“Hong Kong”) of the PRC).

Short to medium term outlook: In view of the persistent epidemic effect across the globe, it is difficult to predict how long it will last. The market currently adopts a wait and see approach to the epidemic effect. As such, it is more difficult for the Board to predict the sales performance of the Group in 2022. Medium to long term outlook: Due to the global demand for footwear still growing continually, more stringent requirement from the manufacturers for the quality of adhesives which would gradually eliminate industry players with less competitiveness and the demand for the use of environmental water-based adhesive products by footwear brands and manufacturers still growing, the effect of the previous regional deployments of the Group has become prominent in response to the market changes. The Group has been maintaining partner relationship with its prestige customers for a number of years. As such, the Board expects that the growth of the Group’s sales in the medium to long term will remain stable. The Group will continue to devote necessary resources to further increase its market share if appropriate. Leveraging on the Group’s solid experience accumulated over the years, its high quality products recognised by the market and its competence in research and development capabilities, the Group will continue to commit to its core business. The Group will also consider to invest and develop its OEM business in a proactive manner in order to broaden its revenue base. Looking ahead, the Board remains prudent and optimistic about the prospects of the Group’s core business in the long term. The Group will follow a very cautious approach to ensure corporate sustainability in 2022. In 2022, the Group will monitor its working capital management closely. The Group will also closely and carefully monitor the latest development of the footwear manufacturing industry and its core business; and the latest development of the epidemic effect and adjust its business strategies from time to time if required.
