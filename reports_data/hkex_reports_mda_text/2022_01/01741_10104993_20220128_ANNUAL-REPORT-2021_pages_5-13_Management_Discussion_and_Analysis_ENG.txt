The Group is a construction contractor in Hong Kong principally providing (i) foundation and site formation works, which mainly include piling works, excavation and lateral support (ELS) works, pile cap construction and ground investigation works; (ii) general building works and associated services, which mainly include development of superstructures, alteration and addition works; and (iii) other construction works, which mainly include slope works and demolition works. The Group is able to undertake construction works as either a main contractor or a subcontractor. Apart from construction works, the Group also provides construction related consultancy services including engineering consulting on construction designs and works supervision, and construction contract administration services. As at 30 September 2021, the Group had 37 construction projects on hand (including projects in progress and projects that are yet to commence) (2020: 27 construction projects on hand) with a total contract value of approximately HK$742.1 million (2020: approximately HK$790.1 million), out of which approximately HK$496.5 million has been recognised as revenue up to 30 September 2021. The details of the Group’s projects on hand as at 30 September 2021 are as follows: Actual/expected commencement Actual/expected July 2016 April 2022 Foundation, ELS and pile cap works for a commercial building in June 2018 May 2022 Slope remedial works for adjoining a residential properties at Mid October 2018 January 2020 Slope works for the fresh water services reservoir at Sheung Shui February 2020 June 2022 June 2020 Land slip prevention and mitigation works in various locations in July 2020 December 2022 Foundation and ELS works for the redevelopment of a office August 2020 October 2020 December 2022 November 2020 June 2022 Fence wall modification minor works for the residential February 2021 September 2023 March 2021 October 2021 March 2021 April 2021 January 2022 April 2021 July 2022 Maintenance works for slopes and retaining walls of a residential April 2021 Slope enhancement works for the residential development project at April 2021 November 2021 Actual/expected commencement Actual/expected Construction of soldier piles, site formation and infrastructure May 2021 June 2021 June 2022 June 2021 June 2021 June 2021 June 2022 April 2022 Ground investigation works for redevelopment of the residential January 2022 July 2022 August 2021 Land contamination assessment works for a industrial building at August 2021 September 2021 October 2021 September 2021 February 2022 September 2021 January 2022 Ground Investigation Works for transitional housing project at September 2021 November 2021 November 2021 August 2022 February 2022 April 2022 Renovation works, fire services installation, addition and alteration works, mechanical ventilation air-conditioning and electricity October 2022 August 2024 Apart from undertaking construction works in Hong Kong, the Group also carries on the health management and consultancy business in the PRC through the sales of health products primarily on a wholesale basis and the sales of health services by providing health management advice and health check referrals for the customers. At the initial stage of the health management and consultancy business, the Group sourced health products from suppliers under third-party brands, which mainly consisted of female hygiene products for female customers in the PRC. During the year ended 30 September 2021, in view of the growing ageing population in the PRC and the increasing health awareness under the outbreak of COVID-19, the Group marketed health products under its own brands for customers in the middle age or older demographic in the PRC, which were Ginseng and related products developed and produced via the cooperation with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies in the PRC. Due to the modification of the product mix for its health products offered in the PRC, revenue from the Group’s health management and consultancy business decreased from approximately HK$21.9 million for the year ended 30 September 2020 to approximately HK$14.4 million for the year ended 30 September 2021. With the gradual development of the health management and consultancy business, the Group will deploy more resources in launching new products under its own brand so as to enhance its product offering and capture further growth opportunities for the business. The Directors are of the view that the general outlook of the construction industry and the business environment in which the Group operates will remain challenging. Although the economy of Hong Kong is showing signs of gradual recovery, benefiting from the acceleration of vaccinations and continued policy support from The Government of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, the Epidemic may continue to affect the construction industry as well as the operation of the Group. In light of the uncertain business environment, the Group will continue to adopt prudent financial management and cost control. Furthermore, the Group will continue to obtain additional qualifications and strengthen its financial resources to better position itself for tendering suitable projects in the public sector as a main contractor, and invest in the manpower and information system to enhance its operational capacity and efficiency. For the health management and consultancy business, the Group will continue to enhance its product offering in the coming year, including the launch of new health products as mentioned above, so as to capture the growth opportunities and accommodate the market demand under the Epidemic. Meanwhile, the Group will continue to explore suitable business and investment opportunities to drive its business growth. The Group’s revenue decreased by approximately HK$80.8 million, or 26.6%, from approximately HK$303.9 million for the year ended 30 September 2020 to approximately HK$223.1 million for the year ended 30 September 2021. The following table sets out a breakdown of the Group’s revenue during the years ended 30 September 2021 and 2020 by segments: The significant decrease in the Group’s revenue was primarily driven by the decrease in revenue contribution from general building works and associated services and other construction works. Such decrease was primarily due to (i) the prolonged delays in the certification of works done for a large scale project for general building works and associated services; and (ii) the lower amount of work done undertaken by the Group for certain projects during the year ended 30 September 2021. Furthermore, due to the modification of the product mix for health products in the PRC, the revenue generated from the Group’s health management and consultancy business also decreased during the year ended 30 September 2021. The decrease was partially offset by the increase in revenue contributed from foundation and site formation works as well as construction related consultancy services, which was mainly due to (i) the commencement of the sizeable projects; and (ii) the increase in value of works being approved for certain projects during the year ended 30 September 2021. Cost of sales decreased by approximately HK$65.7 million, or 24.5%, from approximately HK$267.9 million for the year ended 30 September 2020 to approximately HK$202.2 million for the year ended 30 September 2021. Such decrease was mainly driven by the corresponding decrease in revenue. The gross profit decreased by approximately HK$15.1 million, or 42.1%, from approximately HK$36.0 million for the year ended 30 September 2020 to approximately HK$20.9 million for the year ended 30 September 2021. The Group’s gross profit margin was approximately 11.9% and 9.4% for the years ended 30 September 2020 and 2021, respectively. During the year ended 30 September 2021, the Group recorded a gross loss margin for general building works and associated services (2020: gross profit margin of approximately 10.9%; 2021: gross loss margin of approximately 1.6%), mainly due to (i) the prolonged negotiations between the Group and the customers on progress certification of works done for a large scale project; and (ii) the costs incurred for defect rectification for certain projects. Further, the Group recorded a decrease in gross profit margin for foundation and site formation works (2020: approximately 12.7%; 2021: approximately 6.4%), primarily because the Group undertook certain sizeable projects at a competitive pricing in order to bolster the Company’s profile and enhance future business prospects. Such decrease was partially offset by the increase in gross profit margins for other construction works (2020: approximately 4.8%; 2021: approximately 11.1%) and construction related consultancy services (2020: approximately 2.5%; 2021: approximately 29.5%) with relatively higher gross profit margin projects undertaken during the year ended 30 September 2021. Furthermore, the Group’s gross profit margin for health management and consultancy business increased during the year ended 30 September 2021 (2020: approximately 42.6%; 2021: approximately 55.6%) as less costs attributable to the sales of products were incurred. The other income, gains and losses decreased by approximately HK$2.6 million, or 50.7% from approximately HK$5.2 million for the year ended 30 September 2020 to approximately HK$2.6 million for the year ended 30 September 2021, primarily due to the decrease in bank interest income received during the year ended 30 September 2021. The administrative and other operating expenses increased by approximately HK$13.3 million, or 44.4%, from approximately HK$29.9 million for the year ended 30 September 2020 to approximately HK$43.2 million for the year ended 30 September 2021. Such increase was mainly contributed by (i) the increase in depreciation of right-of-use assets by the new leases of the PRC office entered; and (ii) increase in staff costs due to the increase in the number of employees on payroll for expansion of the Group’s business in the PRC. The Group recorded income tax credit of approximately HK$1.0 million for the year ended 30 September 2021, primarily attributable to the decrease in the taxable profit for the year ended 30 September 2021 (2020: income tax expense of approximately HK$0.7 million). As a result of the foregoing, for the year ended 30 September 2021, the Group recorded a net loss of approximately HK$23.9 million as compared to the net profit approximately HK$10.2 million for the year ended 30 September 2020. The Directors believe that there are certain risks and uncertainties involved in the operations, some of which are beyond the Group’s control. The Directors believe the more significant risks relating to the business are as follows: the Group’s revenue mainly relies on successful tenders of or acceptance of its quotations for construction projects which are non-recurring in nature and any failure of the Group to secure projects from its existing customers and/or new customers in the future would affect the Group’s business operation and financial results; a significant portion of the Group’s revenue was generated from contracts awarded by a limited number of customers, and any significant decrease in the number of projects with the major customers may materially and adversely affect the Group’s financial condition and operating results; the Group relies substantially on subcontractors to help to complete the projects; the Group depends on key management personnel with relevant knowledge, experience and expertise; and the Group determines the price of its quotation or tender based on the estimated time and costs to be involved in a project and the actual time and costs incurred may deviate from its estimate due to unexpected circumstances, thereby leading to cost overruns and adversely affecting the Group’s operations and financial results.
