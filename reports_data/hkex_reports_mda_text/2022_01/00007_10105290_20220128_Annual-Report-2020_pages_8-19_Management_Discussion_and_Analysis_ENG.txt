For the year ended 31 December 2020, the Group’s revenue amounted to approximately HK$1,013.2 million, compared to approximately HK$538.0 million for 2019, representing a increase of approximately HK$475.2 million. The increase was mainly attributable to the increase in the sales of electronic products during the year. The loss attributable to the owners of the Company substantially decreased to HK$211.9 million, a decrease of HK$889.6 million from the profit of HK$677.7 million recorded for the year ended 31 December 2019. The decrease was primarily due to a loss on fair value changes on investment properties incurred of approximately HK$158.9 million (2019: Gain on fair value changes on investment properties of HK$1,011.7 million). The Group owns the land use rights of five land parcels located in Donghai Dao, Zhanjiang Economic and Technological Development Zone, Zhangjiang City, Guangdong Province, the People’s Republic of China (“PRC”) with total site area and total planned gross floor area of approximately 266,000 sq.m. and 1.3 million sq.m. respectively (the “Smart City Project”). The lands are divided into two portions: the portion held for sale (non-commercial portion) and the portion held for investment purpose (including the commercial portion and the car parking spaces). According to the valuation report issued by a recognised valuer at the end of the year, the value of the lands of the Smart City Project was approximately RMB5 billion. The lands of the Smart City Project had been valued approximately the same as the value of the lands of the Smart City Project at 31 December 2019.

The rental income of leasing the property covers an area of approximately 16,300 sq.m. at the Rong Ning Yuan Community of No. 60 Guang An Men Nan Jie, Xicheng District, Beijing, the PRC.

The revenue of financial business of the Group generated from securities, futures and options broking business, underwriting commission, advisory for financial management business and interest income from securities margin loan portfolio and managed to register profit. Despite the economic damages brought by the widespread of Covid-19, both market and turnover increased amid the global Quantitative Easing policy, the massive stimulus program of the US government, the continued listing of Chinese giant companies in Hong Kong attracting investment interests from China and other regions. Market remained volatile as investors were sensitive to the development of Sino-American confrontations, the fear of inflation and the spread of Covid-19 disease. Dow Jones rallied towards new highs towards the second quarter but Hang Seng Index was still capped with range trading under 30,000. Market turnover hopefully expected to be buoyant benefited from more listings of Chinese companies. The Group owns 100% of the exploration, exploitation and operation rights as well as the profit sharing right of Madagascar Oilfield Block 2101 which is an onshore site with total area of 10,400 square kilometers in the northern part of Madagascar.
